# base-alpine 

A simple but powerful base image, based on Alpine Linux with S6 as a process supervisor and dnsmasq both of which have extremely small footprints adding virtually no runtime overhead and a minimal filesystem overhead.

This image aims to be a suitable base image for people who want to deploy to [Tutum](http://tutum.co).
